# Managing Veeam CBT Driver


You can set up Veeam Agent to use the Veeam CBT driver instead of the default CBT mechanism. The Veeam CBT driver offers more efficient changed block tracking mechanism that will be useful for machines running applications with large database files. To learn more about how the Veeam CBT driver works, see [Veeam Changed Block Tracking Driver](backup_cbt_driver.md).

You can perform the following operations with the Veeam CBT driver in Veeam Agent:

* [Install the Veeam CBT driver](cbt_install.md).
* [Remove the Veeam CBT driver](cbt_remove.md).
* [Remove the Veeam CBT driver with Veeam Recovery Media](cbt_remove_media.md).
* [Reset the Veeam CBT driver](cbt_reset.md).
