# Data Restore


Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows offers two data restore scenarios:

* You can perform volume-level restore to recover the entire system image of your computer or specific computer volumes. To learn more, see [Volume-Level Restore](restore_volume.md).

When you perform volume-level restore, you can resize restored volumes to fit available space on target location. To learn more, see [Volume Resize](data_restore_with_volume_resize.md).

* You can perform file-level restore to recover individual files and folders. To learn more, see [File-Level Restore](restore_file.md).

If the backup is encrypted, Veeam Agent will decrypt it during the restore process. To learn more, see [Restore from Encrypted Backups](encryption_restore.md).
