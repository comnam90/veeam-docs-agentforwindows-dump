# Performing Ad-Hoc Backups


In addition to running scheduled backups, you can create ad-hoc backups of your data at any time you need. Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows lets you perform the following types of ad-hoc backups:

* [Incremental ad-hoc backup](backup_incremental.md)
* [Active full backup](backup_active_full.md)
* [Standalone full backup](backup_standalone_full.md)
* [Backup to another location](backup_standalone_full_location.md)
