# Ad-Hoc Backup


You can create ad-hoc backups of your data when you need.

Ad-hoc backups let you capture your data at a specific point in time. You can create ad-hoc backups before you perform some alterations on your computer: install new software or enable a new feature. Ad-hoc backups help you protect your computer from potential data corruption or data loss that can be caused by these operations. If an error occurs, you can always restore data from the ad-hoc backup and bring your computer system to a state before the alteration was made.

Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows lets you create the following types of ad-hoc backups:

* [Incremental backup](adhoc_backup_incremental.md)
* [Standalone full backup](adhoc_backup_full.md)
