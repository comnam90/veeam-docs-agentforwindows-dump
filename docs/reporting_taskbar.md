# Monitoring Backup Process in Taskbar Button


You can monitor the backup process with the Veeam Agent taskbar button. Veeam Agent displays on the taskbar button a green progress bar that reflects the bar for the currently running job session in the control panel. As a result, you can track the process of the backup file creation while working with another application without having to switch to the control panel.
