# Backup Types


Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows lets you create the following backup types:

* [Volume-level backup](volume_backup.md)
* [File-level backup](file_backup.md)

In the file-level backup, you can select what personal data to back up. To learn more, see [Personal Data Backup](personal_files_backup.md).

When backing up the operating system data, you can select the desired backup type. To learn more, see [System State Data Backup](system_state_backup.md).
