# What You Do Next


After you configure the scheduled backup job, Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows displays a clock over its icon in the system tray. The clock identifies that your computer is protected with the scheduled backup job. Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows will periodically start the scheduled backup job to back up selected data and add a new restore point to the backup chain in the target location.

If necessary, you can also perform the following backup operations when you need it:

* [Create a standalone full backup](backup_standalone_full.md)
* [Create an incremental backup](backup_incremental.md)
* [Create an active full backup](backup_active_full.md)

If some of your data gets lost or corrupted, you can do the following:

* [Recover all computer volumes or specific volumes from the backup](volume_restore.md)
* [Recover individual files and folders from the backup](files_restore.md)
