| Consider the following:   * If you have any questions about the product functionality, do not submit a support case through the [Veeam Customer Support Portal](https://www.veeam.com/support.html) and do not send an email to the Veeam Customer Support directly. To submit a support case, use the Control Panel in Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows.  * You can submit a support case only in the Control Panel of the current version of Veeam Agent. If you use an older version of Veeam Agent, upgrade Veeam Agent and check whether the problem still exists in the current version. If the problem exists, use the Control Panel to submit a support case. |
