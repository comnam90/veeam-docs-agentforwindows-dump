# What You Do Next


After the disks are published, go to the C:\VeeamFLR\ folder on the target server to browse disks content.

After you started a disks publishing session, you can view the session statistics or stop the session from the Veeam backup console. To learn more, see [Managing Publishing Disks Session](integration_publish_session.md).
