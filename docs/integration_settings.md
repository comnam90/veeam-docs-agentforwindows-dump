# Configuring Global Settings


Global settings configured on the Veeam backup server apply to Veeam Agent backup jobs as well. You can:

* Configure network throttling settings so that Veeam Agent backup job does not consume all network resources. To learn more, see the [Specifying I/O Settings](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/io_settings.html?ver=13) topic in the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide.
* Configure the following global notification settings to get alerted about the Veeam Agent backup job results:

* Email notifications. Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows sends email notifications on every type of backup tasks, such as backup job sessions started automatically by schedule, backup job sessions started from the command line and ad-hoc backup tasks. To learn more, see the [Specifying Email Notification Settings](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/email_notification_settings.html?ver=13) section in the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide.
* SNMP notifications. To learn more, see the [Specifying SNMP Settings](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/snmp_settings.html?ver=13) section in the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide.
