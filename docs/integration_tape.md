# Archiving Veeam Agent Backups to Tape


You can configure backup to tape jobs to archive Veeam Agent backups to tape.

Backup to tape jobs treat Veeam Agent backups as usual backup files. The archiving job setup and processing procedures practically do not differ from the regular ones. To learn more about backup to tape jobs, see the [Backup to Tape](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/backup_to_tape_jobs.html?ver=13) section in the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide.

| For the After this job option in the backup to tape job schedule settings, you cannot select a backup job managed by Veeam Agent or a standalone Veeam Agent backup job as the preceding backup job. |
