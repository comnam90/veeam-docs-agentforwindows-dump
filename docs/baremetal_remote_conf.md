* [Shared folder settings](baremetal_share.md) — if you have selected the Shared folder option at the [Network Storage](baremetal_remote.md) step of the wizard.
* [Veeam backup repository settings](baremetal_vbr.md) — if you have selected the Veeam backup repository option at the [Network Storage](baremetal_remote.md) step of the wizard.
* [Veeam Cloud Connect repository settings](baremetal_sp.md) — if you have selected the Veeam Cloud Connect repository option at the [Network Storage](baremetal_remote.md) step of the wizard.
