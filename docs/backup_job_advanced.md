# Step 8. Specify Advanced Backup Settings


In the Advanced Settings window, specify advanced settings for the backup job:

* [Backup settings](backup_job_advanced_backup.md)

* [Storage settings](backup_job_advanced_storage.md)

You can access the Advanced Settings window from the following steps of the New Backup Job wizard:

* Bucket/Container — if you have selected the Object storage option at the [Destination](backup_job_target.md) step of the wizard.

* [Shared Folder](backup_job_share.md) — if you have selected the Shared folder option at the [Destination](backup_job_target.md) step of the wizard.
* [Backup Repository](backup_job_vbr.md#repo) — if you have selected the Veeam backup repository option at the [Destination](backup_job_target.md) step of the wizard.
* [Backup Resources](backup_job_sp_settings.md#repo) — if you have selected the Veeam Cloud Connect repository option at the [Destination](backup_job_target.md) step of the wizard.
