# Restricting Network Connections Usage


You can instruct Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows to throttle network traffic for backup jobs and disable backup over Internet connections of certain types. This helps limit the impact of Veeam Agent operations on network performance and avoid extra costs.

Network usage settings apply to all types of backups: scheduled and ad-hoc. To restrict network connections usage for Veeam Agent, you can perform the following tasks:

* [Limit bandwidth consumption for Veeam Agent](settings_network_bandwidth.md).
* [Disable backup over metered connections](metered_connections.md).
* [Disable backup over VPN connections](settings_network_vpn.md).
* [Allow Veeam Agent to use specific Wi-Fi networks only](settings_network_wifi.md).
