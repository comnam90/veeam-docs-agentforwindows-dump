# Data Backup


We recommend that you regularly back up data stored on your computer. Backup creates a safety copy of your data. If any kind of disaster strikes, you can restore your data from the backup and be sure that you will not lose the necessary information.

You can set up Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows to perform automatic scheduled backups (triggered at specific time of the day or on specific events), or you can choose to back up data manually when needed. You can back up the entire computer image, specific computer volumes or individual folders with files.

Backups created with Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows can be saved to one of the following locations:

* Removable storage device
* Local computer drive
* Network shared folder
* On-premises or cloud-based object storage
* Backup repository managed by a Veeam backup server
* Cloud repository managed by a Veeam Cloud Connect service provider
