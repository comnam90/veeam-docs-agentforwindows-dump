# Step 8. Save Restored Files


When the restore settings configuration is complete, Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows opens the Veeam Backup browser displaying the content of the backup file.

You can perform the following operations with restored files and folders:

* [Save files and folders to their initial location](files_restore_initial.md)
* [Save files and folders to a new location](files_restore_new.md)
* [Open files in Microsoft Windows Explorer](files_restore_winexp.md)

  After you finish working with files and folders, [close the Veeam Backup browser](files_restore_close.md).
