# Licensing


You can use Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows as a free product. In this case, you do not need to obtain and install any license.

To work with a commercial version of Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows, you must obtain a license and install it on the protected computer. If you do not install a license, you will be able to use the Free edition of the product only.

If you plan to use a commercial version of the product with Veeam Backup & Replication, you must install and manage the license in the Veeam Backup & Replication console or in Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager. To learn more, see [Managing License](license_vbr.md).
